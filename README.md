# the_todo_app

This is a app build using object oriented programing. The code is not perfect but it's a major improvement over the procedural programing used before.
Also for this app i've used a mvc design pattern to achieve a clean, structured and maintainable code. 
The code is pure javascript(es6) no frameworks involved :) .
