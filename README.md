# the_todo_app

A nice fun app created using pure JavaScript(ES6), no frameworks involved :).

This is a app build using a object oriented programing style. The code is not perfect but it's a major improvement over the procedural programing used before.

Also for this app i've used a MVC design pattern to achieve a clean, structured and maintainable code. 

All the data is fetch as a json file from a Firebase database using a REST API.

# source code
